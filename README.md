# probabilistic_AI_tasks
This repository contains the code of 4 tasks that my team (Emilio Palma, Simone Nascivera and I) solved for the ProbabilisticAI course at ETH Zurich from prof. Andreas Krause.

In every exercise you can find a README file with the description of the task and the solution.

TOPICS
  Task 1: Regression with Gaussian Process
  Task 2: Classification with Bayesian Neural Networks
  Task 3: Bayesian Optimization
  Task 4: Reinforcement Learning
